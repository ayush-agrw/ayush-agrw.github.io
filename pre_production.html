        <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">Ghost in Leiden is a fast-paced cyberpunk action short film set in a
            rain-drenched dystopian city lit by neon and secrets. It follows Nadia—a former assassin and
            gun for hire—who, while breaking
            into the headquarters of a corrupt tech giant to retrieve classified data, stumbles upon
            a buried truth about her past.
            As the city chokes under rain and ruin, Nadia ignites a chain of events that leads to a
            high-speed aerial chase, not just to destroy the ones who stole everything from her… but
            to become something else. Not a weapon. Not a ghost.
            But someone who saves others no matter the cost.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Note: below you will find the results of my brainstorming sessions and the
            development of my main ideas for the short movie. It is a short documentation of my
            pre-production work and also includes a screenplay, storyboard snippets, character designs,
            environment designs + workflow, as well as my image stylization tool that I developed for
            this project...

        <h2 class="title">Screenplay: Ghost in Leiden</h2>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>FADE IN:</b></p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Leiden Cityscape – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">The camera sweeps over the neon-lit streets of Leiden as a train zooms past in the distance. Skyscrapers pierce the dark, clouded sky. The sound of rain and distant city noises fill the air. The scene is a mix of electric blues and toxic greens, casting an eerie glow on the wet streets below.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Neon Billboard – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia, 20, sleek in a matte-black and pink bodysuit with a straight fringe, sits atop a neon billboard. Holographic screens float around her as her fingers dance through the air. The city hums beneath her.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Jax, wearing a threaded cloak and with silver circuit-like lines on his skin, tosses a small device between his hands. He watches Nadia intently.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Jax (softly)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"Are you sure about this, Nadia?"</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia smirks, not breaking focus.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia (confident)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"I'll be in and out before they even notice."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Jax nods, his concern evident.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Jax<br>"Just... don't do anything too crazy. I wouldn't want a friend dying on me."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia stands, the holograms vanishing. She powers up her suit, the red slits glowing brightly.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia (teasing)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"Crazy? Me? Never."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">She leaps off the billboard, her silhouette framed by the neon lights, and disappears into the night.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>City Streets – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia plummets through the rain, activating her flight suit. Thrusters flare as she glides through the narrow alleys and between towering skyscrapers. The city below is a blur of colors and movement.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Flashback</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A sequence of dimly lit memories —</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia, younger, clad in a crude prototype of her bodysuit, steps over bodies in a blood-streaked alley. Her eyes are cold. A target pleads for his life. She silences him with brutal precision.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Another flash — Nadia walks away from a burning building. Her hands tremble. She’s alone. Always alone.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Then —</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A quiet café, sunlight streaming in. Nadia, tense and out of place, meets eyes with a man — kind, warm, unaware of her past.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A montage follows:</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Laughter over drinks. Quiet mornings. Long walks through narrow city streets.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">The final flash —</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A news feed showing a protest crushed by corporate soldiers. Nadia, watching, jaw clenched. The man beside her puts a hand on hers. She closes her eyes.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia (V.O., determined)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"So I chose. No more contracts. No more killing. If I’m going to fight… it’s going to mean something now."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>CyberHelix HQ – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia hovers outside the towering, ominous building. The HQ absorbs the light around it, making it appear as a dark fortress.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia (V.O., calculating)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"Too risky to go from the top."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">A soft beep. Nadia glances at her HUD.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Jax (V.O., urgent)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"I've jammed the ground signals, but you don’t have long."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia dives toward the lower levels, her movements precise. She lands silently behind a delivery truck entering a side entrance.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>CyberHelix HQ – Interior – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia moves swiftly through the dimly lit corridors, her bodysuit blending into the shadows. She bypasses security checkpoints with ease, her eyes scanning for threats.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">She attaches a small device to a scanner. The lights flicker off. She slips through.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>R&D Department – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia enters a dark room lined with rows of terminals and screens. The atmosphere is cold, sterile. The central server hums ominously.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">She sits down at a terminal. Her fingers move quickly across the holographic keyboard. Streams of encrypted data flood the screen.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">The screen flashes as the encryption unlocks. Nadia's eyes widen as she sees a directory labeled "Project Helix 4".</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Her hand hovers over the orb she was sent to retrieve but pauses when she spots another orb — labeled with her brother's name.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Flashback</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">The memory of her brother being taken by CyberHelix operatives. The horror on his face as they drag him away.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia (V.O., whispering, emotional)</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">"They took him... they killed him."</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia's eyes harden. She grabs both the target data and her brother’s memory.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">She activates a virus on the mainframe. The screen turns red, counting down.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Alarm blares. Guards burst into the room.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia’s face sets in determination. She draws her energy blades.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Action Sequence</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia fights with fluid, lethal precision, taking down guards one by one. Her movements are a blur of speed and skill. The countdown continues as she fights, her breath ragged, her muscles straining.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A blow hits Nadia’s head. She stumbles, her vision blurring. A vision of her brother flashes — his smile, his hand reaching toward her.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia rises, fierce and unstoppable. She sends the virus through the network, triggering the self-destruct.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>CyberHelix HQ – Exterior – Night</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia leaps through a window as the building explodes behind her. She soars through the city, chased by CyberHelix guards in flight suits. The chase is intense. The city is a dizzying blur beneath them.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia dodges between buildings, her suit overheating, thrusters failing. She leads the guards into a wind turbine field, cutting her engines and free-falling.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">The guards overshoot, some caught in the turbines, exploding.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia reactivates her thrusters. They sputter.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%">Crash.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia lands hard in a dark alley, rolling to a stop. She’s exhausted, barely able to move.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">A guard lands nearby, battered but alive, weapon raised.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia smiles faintly, knowing she has completed her mission.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Whiteout</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Nadia is bathed in warm, ethereal light. She looks up, seeing her brother, his hand outstretched.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Tears well in Nadia’s eyes as she takes his hand.</p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Together, they walk into the light — leaving the pain and darkness behind.</p>

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>FADE OUT.</b></p>

    <div class="heading">
        <h2 class="title">Environment Design Workflow</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">This layered environment workflow allows for fast iteration and a handcrafted aesthetic while maintaining depth,
            motion, and stylized lighting.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Blockout and Modeling</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Begin by speed-modeling the environment from the camera’s perspective using basic geometric shapes in Blender.
            Use procedural city generation via Geometry Nodes for large-scale urban layouts.
            Add detailed assets from Quixel Megascans to enrich key areas and foregrounds.
        </p>
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/1.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Basic Materials, Lighting and Texture Painting</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Apply basic materials and lighting for structure and readability.
            Perform stylized texture painting directly in Blender with graphic brushwork for key surfaces (walls, streets, props),
            lighting accents, weathering, and hand-drawn surface effects.
            Simulate lighting with hand-painted light maps where 3D lighting isn’t expressive enough.
            Include emissive particles (glow, dust, smog) for atmosphere.
        </p>

        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/3.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/4.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/5.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Graphic Reduction (Skipped in Example)</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Use Grease Pencil for simplified blobs and shapes in background and foreground.
            Design opaque background silhouettes and translucent foreground elements to guide the eye and increase depth.
        </p>
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/5.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Stylization Tool</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Layer in stylized effects (e.g., halftone textures, chromatic aberration, noise effects, vignettes,
            automatic graphic reduction for background elements, paint smears, line hatching) for a sophisticated hybrid 2D/3D feel.
            This also gives the movie a heavily stylized / post-processed look, similar to the Spiderverse movies.
            Compare this result to the picture above...
        </p>
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/output.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Color Grading</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">Render multiple passes (base render, depth, texture overlays, particles).
            Using DaVinci Resolve or Blender, tweak the image contrast, sharpness, and lift + gamma + gain.
            Emphasize light/dark areas with digital painting.
        </p>
        <img class="spaced-video" src="images/preproduction/7.png" alt="modeling" width="90%" height="auto">

        <p style="width: 80%"><b>Stylization Tool</b></p>
        <p style="width: 80%">This was definitely the most interesting and uncertain part of the
            pre-production process. The goal was to give my animated scenes a distinct look and feel
            that stays coherent throughout the movie. The inspiration for this was mostly the
            heavily stylized and post-processed look of Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse, as well as
            certain cyberpunk scenes.
